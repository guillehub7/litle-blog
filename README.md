Small Blog Platform — Full-Stack Application

This project is a lightweight blog platform built using a modern full-stack JavaScript stack. The frontend is developed with React.js, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface, while the backend uses Node.js and Express to handle API requests and manage blog data. All content is stored in MongoDB, enabling flexible and scalable data storage.

The application allows users to create and view blog posts through a clean and intuitive interface, demonstrating core full-stack development concepts such as RESTful API design, client-server communication, and database integration.
